This tests that ARIA grids correctly recognize rows and cells via aria-owns, including after dynamic attribute changes.

Testing grid with aria-owned rows:
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.rowCount === 2
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.columnCount === 2
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.width >= 2 === true
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.height >= 2 === true
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(0, 0).domIdentifier === 'owned-row-cell-1-1'
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(1, 1).domIdentifier === 'owned-row-cell-2-2'

Testing grid with aria-owned cells:
PASS: ownedCellsGrid.rowCount === 1
PASS: ownedCellsGrid.columnCount === 2
PASS: ownedCellsGrid.width >= 2 === true
PASS: ownedCellsGrid.height >= 2 === true
PASS: ownedCellsGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(0, 0).domIdentifier === 'owned-cell-1'
PASS: ownedCellsGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(1, 0).domIdentifier === 'owned-cell-2'

Testing grid with DOM children that are also aria-owned (ordering test):
PASS: domAndOwnedGrid.rowCount === 3
PASS: domAndOwnedGrid.width >= 2 === true
PASS: domAndOwnedGrid.height >= 2 === true
PASS: domAndOwnedGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(0, 0).domIdentifier === 'dom-row-C-cell'
PASS: domAndOwnedGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(0, 1).domIdentifier === 'dom-row-B-cell'
PASS: domAndOwnedGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(0, 2).domIdentifier === 'dom-row-A-cell'

Adding row-3 to aria-owns...
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.rowCount === 3
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(0, 2).domIdentifier === 'owned-row-cell-3-1'

Adding owned-cell-3 to row...
PASS: ownedCellsGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(2, 0).domIdentifier === 'owned-cell-3'

Removing owned-row-1 from aria-owns...
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.rowCount === 2
PASS: ownedRowsGrid.cellForColumnAndRow(0, 0).domIdentifier === 'owned-row-cell-2-1'
