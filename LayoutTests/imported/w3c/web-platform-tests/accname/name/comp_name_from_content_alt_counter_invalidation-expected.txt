Tests the #comp_name_from_content portions of the AccName Name Computation algorithm.

This series of tests exercises the button, heading, and link elements, because each have different characteristics worthy of testing in each of the name computation algorithm scenarios:

button is a leaf node with sub-level elements presentational.
heading is block level, and can contain sub-level interactives like links.
link (a[href]) is an interactive inline element that can include non-presentational descendants.
