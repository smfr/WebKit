Tests minimum computedrole mappings defined in HTML-AAM ([HTML-AAM Issue #454](https://github.com/w3c/html-aam/pull/454)), where the returned computed role for generic elements is expected to change based on the generic elements having attributes that would require the element no longer be generic, and potentially ignored by browsers. Most test names correspond to a unique ID defined in the spec.

Baseline div, role=generic
div with autofocus attribute.
div with explicit role=generic and autofocus attribute.
div with explicit role=none and autofocus attribute.
div with draggable attribute.
div with explicit role=generic and draggable attribute.
div with explicit role=none and draggable attribute.
Show popover div
div with draggable attribute and errant role attribute value.
unnamed section with draggable attribute.
div with explicit role=article and draggable attribute.
article element with draggable attribute.
named section with draggable attribute.
cite element with draggable attribute.
