Test that the audio session retains the MediaPlayback category when a video is paused after being played then unmuted.

** Check category before anything has loaded.
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionCategory() == 'None') OK

** Check category when a muted, paused, element has loaded.
EVENT(canplaythrough)
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionCategory() == 'None') OK
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionMode() == 'Default') OK

** Check category when a muted element is playing.
RUN(video.play())
EVENT(playing)
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionCategory() == 'None') OK
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionMode() == 'Default') OK
EXPECTED (internals.routeSharingPolicy() == 'Default') OK

** Check category when an unmuted element is playing.
RUN(video.muted = false)
EVENT(volumechange)

EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionCategory() == 'MediaPlayback') OK
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionMode() == 'Default') OK
EXPECTED (internals.routeSharingPolicy() == 'LongFormAudio') OK

** Pause the element, check again after 500ms.
RUN(video.pause())
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionCategory() == 'MediaPlayback') OK
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionMode() == 'Default') OK
EXPECTED (internals.routeSharingPolicy() == 'LongFormAudio') OK

** And check again after 3 seconds.
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionCategory() == 'MediaPlayback') OK
EXPECTED (internals.audioSessionMode() == 'Default') OK
EXPECTED (internals.routeSharingPolicy() == 'LongFormAudio') OK
END OF TEST
