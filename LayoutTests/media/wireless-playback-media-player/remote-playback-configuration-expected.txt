Test that the wireless playback media engine is configured with a video's current time, playback rate, and playing state when a MediaDeviceRoute activates.

RUN(video.src = findMediaFile('video', '../content/test'))
RUN(video.currentTime = 3)
RUN(video.playbackRate = 0.25)
RUN(internals.mockMediaDeviceRouteController.activateRoute(route))
RUN(route.timeRange = { start: 0, duration: 6 })
RUN(route.ready = true)
EVENT(playing)
EXPECTED (route.currentPlaybackPosition >= '3') OK
EXPECTED (route.playbackRate == '0.25') OK
EXPECTED (route.playing == 'true') OK
END OF TEST
