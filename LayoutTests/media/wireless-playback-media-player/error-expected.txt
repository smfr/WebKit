Test that a 'error' event is dispatched when a MediaDeviceRoute encounters a playback error after becoming ready to play a URL.

RUN(internals.mockMediaDeviceRouteController.activateRoute(route))
RUN(video.src = findMediaFile('video', '../content/test'))
RUN(video.play())
EVENT(canplaythrough)
RUN(route.hasPlaybackError = true)
EVENT(error)
END OF TEST
