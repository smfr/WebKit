== Running test suite: SiteIsolation.Runtime.CrossOriginEvaluate
-- Running test case: SiteIsolation.Runtime.CrossOrigin.FrameTargetCreated
PASS: Added target should have Frame type.
PASS: Cross-origin frame target should have a RuntimeAgent.
PASS: Cross-origin frame target should eventually have an ExecutionContext.

-- Running test case: SiteIsolation.Runtime.CrossOrigin.EvaluatePassphrase
PASS: Cross-origin frame should have passphrase 'cross-origin-secret'.
PASS: Main page should have passphrase 'main-page-value'.
PASS: Cross-origin frame and main page should have different passphrase values.

-- Running test case: SiteIsolation.Runtime.CrossOrigin.EvaluateHostname
PASS: Cross-origin frame hostname should differ from main page hostname.
Main page hostname: 127.0.0.1
Cross-origin frame hostname: localhost

-- Running test case: SiteIsolation.Runtime.CrossOrigin.CallFunctionOn
PASS: Creating object in cross-origin frame should not throw.
PASS: Created object should have an objectId.
PASS: callFunctionOn should return the object's key value.
